# Churn Predict Rate
## Problem
Churn rate is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers who leave a business over a specific time period. . Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value is based on:

  1. User demographic information
  2. Browsing behavior
  3. Historical purchase data among other information

It factors in our unique and proprietary predictions of how long a user will remain a customer. This score is updated every day for all users who have a minimum of one conversion. The values assigned are between 1 and 5.

## Output 
Make prediction for the risk of the churn score
